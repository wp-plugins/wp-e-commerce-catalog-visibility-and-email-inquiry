WP e-Commerce Catalog Visibility and Email Inquiry uses the WordPress email config and requires no external email plugin. The email sent to the WP e-Commerce email admin address from each product inquiry contains:

* Senders Name
* Senders Email address
* Senders Phone
* Product name the inquiry is sent from as the email subject plus a link to the product page they sent the inquiry from.
* Senders Message.

WP e-Commerce Catalog Visibility and Email Inquiry Lite is very simple to set up. Once you have installed and activated go to you wp_admin dashboard Settings > Store > Catalog Visibility Tab.

= WP e-Commerce Version Compatibility =

Please note that WP e-Commerce Catalog Visibility and Email Inquiry requires that you have <strong>WP e-Commerce version 3.8.8.5 and after</strong> to work. Older versions of WP e-Commerce do not support the functions to hook the email inquiry button to the add to cart button.

= WP e-Commerce Theme Compatibility =

Whilst you might have version 3.8.8.5 your theme may still use an earlier version of code. For the Email Inquiry button to show on the single product pages and products pages you must ensure that it has this 

code do_action('wpsc_product_form_fields_begin') and do_action('wpsc_product_form_fields_end') in these files:

* wpsc-grid_view.php
* wpsc-list_view.php
* wpsc-products_page.php
* wpsc-single_product.php

= Lite Version Support =

As a Lite Version user please post all support requests to the plugins WordPress Support forum. We do not watch that forum and posting there you will be relying on another user for support not an a3rev team member. Pro Version Licence holders have 'write' access to the a3rev support forum and Lifetime priority support, not from support staff but from the developers.

= Documentation =

Find detailed step-by-step set up and configuration instructions in the [plugins documents](http://docs.a3rev.com/user-guides/wp-e-commerce/wpec-catalog-visibility-and-email-inquiry/) on the a3rev wiki.

= Pro Version =

For those who want more control there is a PRO Version upgrade. The PRO version advanced features include:

= Global Settings: =
* Set custom email recipient (different to the default WPEC admin email)
* Set a cc recipient
* Set your own custom Email Button title and set custom style for email button.
* Use text on page with hyperlink pop-up email form instead of the Email Button 
* Customize Hyperlink text
* Style pop-up window email form and submit button.
* Customize the successfully submitted message that shows in the pop up when a message has been sent.

And for ultimate control:

* Change Button for linked text and visa versa - Change button title or link text.
* Only show this products settings on the single product page or on all catalog listing thumbnails.

= Priority Support =

Please note that we do not provide support for our Lite Version plugins. Hundreds of thousands of plugin downloads has proven that vast majority of the support requests we get have nothing to do with our plugins but are related to bugs in the users theme or other plugins they have installed. We give priority support to those users who purchase a Pro Version license. In this plugins case, we offer a single payment, Lifetime License fee which includes access to and full support from the a3rev developers on the plugins support forum.

* English (default) - always included.
*.po file (wpec_pcf.po) in languages folder for translations.

* Fix - Replaced hardcode iso-8859-1 charset to dynamic get_option('blog_charset')
* Fix - Updated all JavaScript functions so that the plugin is compatible with jQuery Version1.9 and backwards to version 1.6. WordPress still uses jQuery version 1.8.3. In themes that use Google js Library instead of the WordPress jQuery then there was trouble because Google uses the latest jQuery version 1.9. There are a number of functions in jQuery Version 1.9 that have been depreciated and hence this was causing errors with the jQuery function in the plugin.

= 1.0.5 - 2013/01/25 =

* Fix - Email Delivery address - when the plugin is installed it now checks for WP e-Commerce Store Admin Email address and uses that if one has been entered. If it does not find a Store Admin Email Address, then it checks for and uses the WordPress admin email address. The WP e-Commerce Store Admin Email address always takes priority the WordPress Admin email address. This means that if the Store admin address is entered after the WP e-Commerce Catalog Visibility an Email Inquiry is installed it auto becomes the plugins delivery address.

= 1.0.4 - 2013/01/19 =
* Tweak - Added auto support for custom button type for 'add to cart' button so that our plugin can find the add to cart button on themes that use custom button code.
