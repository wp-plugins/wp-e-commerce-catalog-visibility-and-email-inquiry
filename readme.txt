= WP e-Commerce Version Compatibility =

Please note that WP e-Commerce Catalog Visibility and Email Inquiry requires that you have <strong>WP e-Commerce version 3.8.8.5 and after</strong> to work. Older versions of WP e-Commerce do not support the functions to hook the email inquiry button to the add to cart button.

= WP e-Commerce Theme Compatibility =

Whilst you might have version 3.8.8.5 your theme may still use an earlier version of code. For the Product Page Rules Hide Add to Cart and Show Email Inquiry button to work on the single product pages and product cards the theme must have these 2 core WP e-Commerce functions: 

* code do_action('wpsc_product_form_fields_begin') 
* do_action('wpsc_product_form_fields_end') 

in these files:

* wpsc-grid_view.php
* wpsc-list_view.php
* wpsc-products_page.php
* wpsc-single_product.php

= Mobile Responsive App style admin interface =

* 100% compatible with WordPress v3.9.0 admin interface.
* Backward compatibility to WordPress v3.7.0
* App style admin inteface.
* Admin interface is optimized for mobiles and tablets.

= Lite Version Support =

As a Lite Version user please post all support requests to the plugins WordPress Support forum. We do not watch that forum and posting there you will be relying on another user for support not an a3rev team member. Pro Version Licence holders have 'write' access to the a3rev support forum and Lifetime priority support, not from support staff but from the developers.

= Pro Version =

For those who want more control there is a [PRO Version upgrade](http://a3rev.com/shop/catalog-visibilty-and-email-inquiry/). 

The PRO version advanced features include:

* The Pro Version includes the additional Product Page Rule: Hide Product Prices.
* Per Product Page Customization. Customize Product Page Rules for every individual product from the Product page Email and Cart meta.
* Gives you tremendous flexibility in setting up a mixed 'add to cart' and product brochure store.
* Point and click Email Inquiry button creator - allows you to style the button anyway you like without writing a line of code.
* Point and click pop-up form creator allows you to style your email pop-up form without writing a line of code.
* Option to show the Email Inquiry Button or Hyperlink text on product card (Grid View)
* Option to allow the sender to send a copy of the Email Inquiry form they are submitting to themselves.
* Set Email Sender Options - Set the email 'From Name' and 'From Email Address'

And for ultimate control:

= Customize Single Product Page: =
* Customize Catalog visibility settings and email inquiry settings on any single product page. 
* Over-ride any of the global Catalog Visibility options from the product page.
* Change the Email Inquiry form primary recipient and cc recipient
* Change Button for linked text and visa versa - Change button title or link text.
* Only show this products settings on the single product page or on all catalog listing thumbnails.

= Priority Support =

Please note that we do not provide support for our Lite Version plugins. Hundreds of thousands of plugin downloads has proven that vast majority of the support requests we get have nothing to do with our plugins but are related to bugs in the users theme or other plugins they have installed. We give priority support to those users who purchase a Pro Version license. In this plugins case, we offer a single payment, Lifetime License fee which includes access to and full support from the a3rev developers on the plugins support forum.

* Fix - Replaced hardcode iso-8859-1 charset to dynamic get_option('blog_charset')
* Fix - Updated all JavaScript functions so that the plugin is compatible with jQuery Version1.9 and backwards to version 1.6. WordPress still uses jQuery version 1.8.3. In themes that use Google js Library instead of the WordPress jQuery then there was trouble because Google uses the latest jQuery version 1.9.

* Tweak - Added an on screen Attention message if the plugin does not find a WP e-Commerce store admin email address. Notifies the user that the WordPress admin email address is being used by the plugin as the 'send to' address and asks the user to add a WP e-commerce Store email address.
* Fix - Email Delivery address - when the plugin is installed it now checks for WP e-Commerce Store Admin Email address and uses that if one has been entered. If it does not find a Store Admin Email Address, then it checks for and uses the WordPress admin email address. The WP e-Commerce Store Admin Email address always takes priority the WordPress Admin email address. This means that if the Store admin address is entered after the WP e-Commerce Catalog Visibility an Email Inquiry is installed it auto becomes the plugins delivery address.

= 1.0.4 - 2013/01/19 =
* Tweak - Added auto support for custom button type for 'add to cart' button so that our plugin can find the add to cart button on themes that use custom button code.

* Tweak - Updated Support and Pro Version link URL's on wordpress.org description, plugins and plugins dashboard. Links were returning 404 errors since the launch of the all new a3rev.com mobile responsive site as the base e-commerce permalinks is changed.

= 1.0.2 - 2012/08/27 =
* Tweak: Updated WordPress description text and readme to show the WP e-Commerce 3.8.8.5 do_action functions that must be included in themes for the Email Button to show. Some older themes don't have updated function and even though users have the 3.8.8.5 WP e-commerce version the button can't show.
* Fix - Combined button and pop-up window style scripts in one script to overcome javascript conflict with some IE javascript styling scripts.
* Documentation - Plugin documentation completed.
